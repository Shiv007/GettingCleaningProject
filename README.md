# "Getting and Cleaning Data" 

## Initial data
The script is invented to analyze the data from UCI HAR Dataset. 

It's supposed that archive is extracted to the working directory.
here it is ./UCI HAR Dataset

### The following files from the initial dataset is used:

features.txt - includes the descriptions for features measured
train/X_train.txt - includes the measurements of the features in train set (one row - 1 measurement of 561 features)
test/X_test.txt - includes the measurements of the features in test set
train/subject_train.txt - subject for each measurement from the train set
test/subject_test.txt - subject for each measurement from the test set
train/y_train.txt - activity (from 1 to 6) for each measurement from the train set
test/y_test.txt - activity (from 1 to 6) for each measurement from the test set


In this project I have performed all below 5 steps mentioned in the question:

(Please Refer R script run_analysis.R that does the following.)

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
